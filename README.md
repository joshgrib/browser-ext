# browser-ext

A browser extension for me to run my own scripts on web pages to add utilities

I started with [this guide](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/how-to-make-a-chrome-extension)

To bundle and update the extension:

1. Run `yarn bundle`
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Click `Load unpacked`
4. Select the `dist` directory in this folder
